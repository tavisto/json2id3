C++ Id3 Tag utility to write id3 tags to an audio file. 
The tags can be read from a json file.

Currently supports AIFF, and MP3 files.
 - text encoding, when required, is hard-coded to UTF8
 - text languate, when required, is hard-coded to 'eng'

This requires both taglib and jsonlib. 

TagLib: http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html
jsonlib: https://github.com/thanatos/libjson

Thanks to both those projects to make this one possible.

This project requires an 'out of source build'. 

This means you need a build directory in order to build this. 

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
